Data for South Asia West (MD5 checksum) taken from https://www.glims.org/RGI/rgi60_dl.html on 11/03/2020

The Randolph Glacier Inventory, a global inventory of glacier outlines, may be used freely with due acknowledgement.
 It is intended for the estimation of total ice volumes and glacier mass changes at global and large-regional scales.
 It is supplemental to the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space initiative (GLIMS). Production of the RGI was 
 motivated by the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5). Future updates
 will be made to the RGI and the GLIMS Glacier Database in parallel during a transition period. As all these data are
 incorporated into the GLIMS Glacier Database and as download tools are developed to obtain GLIMS data in the RGI data
 format, the RGI will evolve into a downloadable subset of GLIMS, offering complete one-time coverage, version control,
 and a standard set of attributes.
